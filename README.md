# 9-forkify_myversion
New features added to Udemy's "The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects!", Section 9: Modern JavaScript: Using ES6, NPM, Babel and Webpack

The goal of this asisted app creation is applying the knowledge of previous lectures about ES-6, asynchronous programming and modern module workflow. And encouraging an MVC design pattern with separation of concerns.

Once finished the app, the teacher suggests applying some more features in order to consolidate the learnings. Besides those features, I toke note of some others during the lectures; It can be reviewed in the TODO.txt file which is also tracked.

This is an ongoing project were I'm using Node 10.15.3; I strongly recommend you to do so.

Some of the accomplished achievements are:

1-Extract list, likes and search controllers to its own modules. The recipes' one  seems still a bit coupled so refactor is needed.

2-Delete list button.

3-Save shopping list at local storage then print it.

4-Avoid ingredient item repetition when added at shopping lisst. Working when units and ingredients' strings are coincident: other casuistics need parsing algorithm improvements.

5-Allow adding individual ingredients from recipe to shoping list.
